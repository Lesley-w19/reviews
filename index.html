         <p class="info"> They are also called Fish-Tanks. Fishkeeping especially in the home 
             is one of the most exciting hobbies one can have. Among the many benefits it has are; it can act as a
             stress-releiver,  gives an ample environment of meditation as well as thinking,it hepls decorate a home,
             excite visitors as well as give one a sense of responsibitlity in terms of timely feeding of the fish, 
             cleaning the aquariam regularly among other tasks. I recommend ones start in this adventure of home 
             fishkeeping as it is wonderful, motivating if not inspiring.

              <p class="info" id="fishabout">Goldfish is the most popular freshwater aquarium fish of all time.
                  They come in different varities and colors which are very easy to keep. Goldfish prefer
                  a cooler environment(68-75`F) and do well on a simple flake food diet - no special feeding required.
